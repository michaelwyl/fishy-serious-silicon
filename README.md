## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
I used Google to look for some specific syntax related to HTML since it is my first time using it. I am not entirely sure about the syntax.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
When implementing the final logic of the function. I was confused at first. Then I figured it out by writing a pseudocode and test manually to make sure it works.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
After completing this submission, I have a better understanding towards web development and wonder if I could use the methods I learned to build a game on the web.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
I would spend time on completely randomizing the patterns as now my submission could only change the pattern manually.
